Kin SDET challenge


## Dependencies and expectations
- Bundler should be installed: `gem install bundler`
- rspec: `gem install rspec`

If you want to use rspec-expectations with rspec, just install the rspec gem and RubyGems will also install rspec-expectations for you

## Running the tests
- `bundle exwc rspec` - because of the tree set up it is structured that the individual does not need to use the rspec tags and editing the provided env vars to point to the location you want your tests to run.
